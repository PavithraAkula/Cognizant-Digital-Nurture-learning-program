css:

Contains all the Bootstrap styles.
bootstrap.css: Full unminified version (for learning/editing).
bootstrap.min.css: Minified version for production (smaller and faster to load).
*.map: Source map files (helpful for debugging with developer tools).

js:

Contains Bootstrap's JavaScript functionalities.
bootstrap.bundle.js / bootstrap.bundle.min.js: Includes Bootstrap JS and Popper.js (required for tooltips, dropdowns, etc.).
bootstrap.js / bootstrap.min.js: Only Bootstrap’s JS without Popper (you’d need to include Popper separately if using these).

icons(if downloaded):

A separate icon library (bootstrap-icons) used to add vector icons easily. Each icon is an SVG or included via a CSS file.
