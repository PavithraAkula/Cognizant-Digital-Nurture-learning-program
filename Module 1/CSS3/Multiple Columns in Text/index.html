    <h2>Community News</h2>
    <p>
      This is a news article. The text will be shown in two columns side by side, just like a newspaper. 
      The space between the columns will be 30 pixels, and a thin gray line will separate the columns.
    </p>
    <p>
      Using multiple columns helps make long text easier to read and looks more professional.
      CSS3 allows you to do this easily with just a few lines of code.
